# Project Understanding

Use this file to store durable understanding about a specific codebase or product after reading its source.

Treat it as shared memory across supported tool surfaces.

## What to store

- what the project is
- who it appears to serve
- the main workflows or business purpose
- the stack and architecture style
- the likely source-of-truth files
- the most relevant expert skills for future work

## What not to store

- temporary debugging notes
- one-off task chatter
- guesses that were never confirmed

## Festivent Portal (sibling codebase)

- Location: Confirmed: `../festivent-portal/` relative to this repo when both live under the same parent folder (e.g. `Documents/Safwan`).
- What it is: Confirmed: Laravel 8 admin-only panel for the Festivent marketplace (vendors, bookings, reports, impersonation); not for end customers.
- Stack: Confirmed: Laravel, PHP 7.3/8.0, MySQL, Bootstrap admin theme, Billplz.
- Admin gate: Confirmed: `user_type == '1'` on protected routes; must not be removed.
- Security note (from their AGENTS.md): Confirmed: impersonation authorization check is commented out — treat as critical gap before shipping auth changes.
- Source-of-truth files: Confirmed: `festivent-portal/AGENTS.md`, `routes/web.php`, `app/Http/Controllers/`, `resources/views/admin/`.
- Bossku alignment: Confirmed: `festivent-portal/AGENTS.md` summarizes Bossku skills; Cursor rule `festivent-portal/.cursor/rules/bosskuai.mdc` points here for full skill roster and memory.
- Most relevant Bossku skills for typical work: Inferred: `bosskuai-engineering-delivery`, `bosskuai-coding-best-practices`, `bosskuai-cybersecurity-risk`, `bosskuai-ui-ux-design-to-code`, `bosskuai-business-logic-review`.

## BosskuAI

- Project type: Confirmed: Public reusable AI cofounder starter for product-building teams.
- Core purpose: Confirmed: Package one assistant setup that can reason across product, planning, project management, engineering, design, security, business logic, launch, marketing, sales, SEO/GEO, and AI model selection.
- Primary users: Confirmed: Founders, product teams, and operators who want one assistant package rather than many disconnected prompt files.
- Tool posture: Confirmed: Tool-agnostic starter with specific entry points for Codex, Claude, and Cursor.
- Source-of-truth files: Confirmed: `AGENTS.md` is the root instruction source; `.codex/AGENTS.md` adds Codex-specific guidance; `README.md` and `WORKSPACE-ONBOARDING.md` are the main public onboarding docs.
- Knowledge layout: Confirmed: `ai-assistant/skills/` contains the expert surfaces; `ai-assistant/references/` contains checklists, playbooks, pitfalls, and ADRs; `ai-assistant/memory/` is shared durable memory across tools.
- Current expert surface size: Confirmed: 39 skills, 39 checklists, and 35 playbooks are present in the repo.
- Codex support shape: Confirmed: `.codex/config.toml` enables multi-agent mode with read-only `planner`, `explorer`, `reviewer`, `security_reviewer`, `docs_researcher`, and `tdd_guide` roles.
- Current strength: Inferred: BosskuAI is stronger at curated cofounder-style breadth and cross-functional judgment than at harness automation.
- Current gap: Confirmed: The repo now has an initial Claude command layer, starter install/check scripts, maintenance workflows for skill and rule review, a dedicated continuous-learning workflow, and optional advisory hook-ready scripts, but it still has no fully integrated always-on hook system and remains intentionally proposal-first rather than silently self-mutating.
- Strategic direction worth preserving: Inferred: BosskuAI should stay curated instead of expanding into a very large agent catalog. The next gains still come from commands, installability, verification flows, continuous learning, and maintenance hygiene rather than adding many more expert personas.
- Former backlog areas now promoted: Confirmed: API design, DevOps / IaC, data / schema architecture, i18n / l10n, analytics / metrics, and legal / compliance now exist as dedicated skills instead of future-skill placeholders.
- Most relevant skills for future BosskuAI work: Confirmed: `bosskuai-workspace-assistant`, `bosskuai-project-understanding`, `bosskuai-search-first`, `bosskuai-skill-stocktake`, `bosskuai-rules-distill`, `bosskuai-continuous-learning`, `bosskuai-planning-execution`, `bosskuai-engineering-delivery`, `bosskuai-agent-security-hardening`, and `bosskuai-ai-model-selection`.
- Install flow: Confirmed: `scripts/install.sh` and `scripts/install.ps1` apply the BosskuAI workspace layer into a target project; `scripts/check-workspace.sh` validates that the expected files are present.
- Maintenance flow: Confirmed: BosskuAI now includes skill stocktake and rules distillation workflows, matching Claude commands, and deterministic helper scripts under `ai-assistant/scripts/` for collecting maintenance context safely.
- Learning hygiene flow: Confirmed: BosskuAI now includes a dedicated continuous-learning skill, checklist, playbook, Claude command, and `ai-assistant/scripts/learning-doctor.sh` for freshness checks on memory and continuation state.
- Hook posture: Confirmed: BosskuAI now includes optional hook-ready reminder scripts under `ai-assistant/hooks/`, but they are advisory only and intentionally avoid automatic memory or rule mutation.
