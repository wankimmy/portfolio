# BosskuAI Analytics / Metrics

Use this skill when the main question is **what to measure, how to instrument it, and whether the numbers will support good decisions**.

## How this differs from nearby skills

- **`bosskuai-product-strategy`**: defines product bets and hypotheses; this skill defines how those bets will be measured.
- **`bosskuai-marketing-growth`**: optimizes acquisition and distribution; this skill designs measurement across product and growth surfaces.
- **`bosskuai-engineering-delivery`**: implements tracking; this skill decides the event model, funnel definitions, and metric semantics first.

## Mindset

- If a metric can’t drive a decision, it is probably vanity.
- Event definitions are contracts; sloppy naming creates years of bad dashboards.
- Funnel stages must map to real user behavior, not wishful narratives.
- Instrumentation should be privacy-conscious and operationally debuggable.

## Measurement lenses

**Outcome alignment**
- What decision or hypothesis will this metric support?
- Is there a north-star or guardrail metric?
- What would success or failure look like?

**Event model**
- Are events named for user actions or system facts clearly?
- Is event grain explicit?
- Are properties stable, typed, and necessary?

**Funnels and experiments**
- Are stages mutually understandable and time-bounded?
- Can drop-off be explained by available events?
- Are experiment variants and exposure events explicit?

**Retention and lifecycle**
- Are D1/D7/D30 retention curves defined and baselined?
- Are users segmented by acquisition cohort, so retention is compared on an apples-to-apples basis?
- Is the distinction between resurrection (returning after churn) and retention (never churned) explicit?
- Is churn defined precisely: no activity for N days? Explicit cancellation? Both?

**Attribution and identity**
- How are users, sessions, orgs, devices, and anonymous states linked?
- Where can attribution be lost or duplicated?
- Are cross-platform identities reconciled clearly?

**Data quality**
- Are dedupe, sampling, clock skew, and late events handled?
- Is there a way to verify the numbers against source actions?
- What monitoring catches tracking drift?

**Privacy and retention**
- Is sensitive data unnecessarily captured?
- Are consent and retention requirements reflected in instrumentation?
- Can deletion or subject-access obligations be honored?

## Workflow

1. **Read the current measurement surface** — event docs, analytics code, dashboards, experiment tooling, and product specs.
2. **Define the decision question first** — what decision needs support and what metric would change behavior?
3. **Map the event model** — user actions, system facts, experiment exposures, identity joins, and funnel stages.
4. **Review data quality and attribution risks** — duplicates, missing events, late events, cross-device issues, and naming drift.
5. **Review privacy constraints** — PII, consent, retention, and deletion expectations.
6. **Recommend the smallest instrumentation slice** — add or refine only what supports a real decision.
7. **Name the validation plan** — how the team will verify the instrumentation is correct after shipping.

## Guardrails

- If the request is general, ambiguous, or touches many files — ask clarifying yes/no questions **before acting**. Use numbered bullets with explicit answer format: e.g. `1-yes/no  2-A/B`.
- Do not add events with no clear decision owner.
- Do not stuff unbounded blobs or sensitive data into event properties.
- Do not define funnels without precise event semantics and time windows.
- Do not treat dashboard completeness as proof that the data is correct.

## Retention and lifecycle metrics

Use this section when the task involves understanding whether users are staying, why they leave, or how to measure product stickiness.

### Cohort analysis design
- A cohort groups users who shared a common experience at a common time (e.g. "users who signed up in March 2026").
- Compare retention across cohorts, not across all users — this isolates product changes from acquisition mix shifts.
- Use weekly or monthly cohort windows for B2B; daily or weekly for high-frequency consumer apps.
- Always normalize cohort size before comparing absolute retention numbers.

### D1/D7/D30 retention patterns
- **D1 (Day 1 retention)**: % of users who returned the day after their first session. Measures first-impression stickiness and onboarding effectiveness.
- **D7 (Week 1 retention)**: % of users who returned within 7 days. Measures whether the core value proposition was realized in the first week.
- **D30 (Month 1 retention)**: % of users still active at 30 days. The primary signal for product-market fit in most consumer products.
- Healthy SaaS benchmarks (B2B): D30 > 70%. Consumer apps: D30 > 25% is strong. Below 10% requires urgent product investigation.
- Track the retention curve shape, not just the endpoints: a curve that plateaus (even at 15%) indicates a retained core segment; a curve that keeps falling to zero indicates no retained segment.

### Churn signal identification
- Define churn precisely before measuring it: is it inactivity for N days, explicit cancellation, or payment failure?
- Leading churn indicators appear before churn: declining login frequency, drop in core feature usage, support ticket volume, failed payment attempts.
- Segment churn by acquisition source, plan tier, company size, and cohort — aggregate churn hides the actionable signal.
- Resurrection rate (churned users who return) is a separate metric from retention; conflating them inflates apparent retention.

### Lifecycle stage metrics
Define explicit lifecycle stages and instrument the transitions between them:

| Stage | Definition | Key metric |
|-------|-----------|-----------|
| **Acquisition** | User created account | Signup rate |
| **Activation** | User completed the "aha moment" action | Activation rate |
| **Habit** | User returns without prompting in the first 7 days | D7 retention |
| **Engagement** | User uses the core feature ≥ X times per week | Weekly active usage rate |
| **Expansion** | User upgrades, adds seats, or uses more features | Expansion MRR % |
| **Dormancy** | User has not returned in N days but not churned | Dormancy rate |
| **Churn** | User meets the churn definition | Churn rate |
| **Resurrection** | Churned user returns | Resurrection rate |

Instrument the transition between each adjacent stage, not just the stages themselves — the transition events reveal where users drop off.
