## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- XAMPP (for local deployment)

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Development

```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:5173`

This will start the Vite development server with hot module replacement.

### 3. Build for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

The built files will be in the `dist` folder.

### 4. Deploy to XAMPP

1. **Build the project:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Copy files to XAMPP:**
   - Copy ALL contents from the `dist` folder
   - Paste them into your XAMPP htdocs folder (e.g., `C:\xampp\htdocs\safwan\`)

3. **Add your profile image:**
   - Add your profile photo as `profile.jpg` in the `assets` folder
   - The image should be at least 320x320 pixels for best quality

4. **Start XAMPP:**
   - Open XAMPP Control Panel
   - Start Apache
   - Access your portfolio at `http://localhost/safwan/`

### 5. Development in XAMPP (Optional)

If you want to develop directly in XAMPP without building:
1. Keep your Vue source files in the project
2. Use Vite dev server on port 5173 during development
3. Only build and copy to XAMPP when ready for production
